# Full-stack Portfolio Project

This project is designed to test all of the skills you've learned so far. By the end of this project, you should have a portfolio-ready project you can share on your resume as well as with potential employers.

This project will:

- Have a deployed back-end application.
- Have a deployed front-end application.
- Have a database with one or more tables.

- Have a theme and unique product design.

## Proposal:
I am creating a writing app where people can post their writing. 

**USER STORIES**

1. As a User, I will be greeted by a log-in modal on the landing page that asks for email, password or signup. 

> If user does not have an account they will be redirected to sign up giving their username, email, and password. If they do have an account they will be navigated to the home page. 

2. As a User, I will see several useful articles on display as well as a button that navigates the user to a create page or (write section) where they can create, post, edit and delete articles. 

3. As a User, I will be able to click and read the articles available. 

4. As a User, I can utilize the search bar on the home page to find as well as filter articles by topics.

**Flow Chart**

**Stretch features**

1. As a User, when navigated to the create page, I will be taken to a form that counts words entered as well as suggests synonyms from a dictionary API while writing

1. As a user, I will be able to log in to my account which allows me to edit and delete only my work. 

1. As a user, I can bookmark works that I enjoy. 

1. As a user, I will be navigated to a TOS upon signup that suggests against copy infringement and protects admin from legal. 

1. As a user pronouns will be available on profile. 

1. As a user, I will see a comment, like, and view feature.

**JD suggests**
>For this iteration, I would suggest creating the writings, maybe seeding some of the writings so that the user can see all writings. Focus on the crud for the writings. If you are able to get that done, you can actually easily count the words with a function in your front or back-end using a function so that part seems doable. I would hold off on the dictionary api. If you finish all this I would maybe work on bookmark next. copy infringement page is not a tough goal either. You could create a modal that popped up after a certain time with the TOS if you wanted and you have to click Agree in order to continue. That's a stretch goal though.

### Instructor Questions

You will have 5 tokens which can be redeemed for questions to the instructors during this sprint. Clarifying questions about the project instructions and requirements are not included.


### Required Additional features or tasks

Each Fellow must also define _one or more_ additional features or tasks they would like to add to their application. These features or tasks must be approved by an instructor and should make a meaningful improvement to your application. Below is a list of example features that could apply to any application. You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific application.

> **Note:** These features _do count_ for the rubric category "technical innovation", detailed above.

- Add a one-to-many table relationship to your database.
- Use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) to create seed data for your database. (Include a screenshot or screenshots of the prompts in your README.md)
- Use [express-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator) on your back-end to validate incoming data.
- Create custom middleware as part of your back-end application that validates for particular values when a resource is being created or updated.
- Learn and use a [React Library](https://www.simform.com/blog/react-libraries/) and/or [Component Library](https://technostacks.com/blog/react-component-libraries/) to enhance your application.
- Learn and use a [CSS Library](https://blog.logrocket.com/top-10-react-ui-libraries-kits/) to design & make your application responsive.
- Visually display errors to your user when they incorrectly fill out a form attempting to create or update a resource.
- Use Modals to display information or errors to your users
- Use query parameters to filter your resource by different fields or qualities.
- When viewing all resources, break up your resources visually onto multiple pages. (pagination)
- Allow for a list of "favorite" resources that are stored locally through [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

## Getting started

**DO NOT FORK this repository.** Instead, create your front-end and back-end repositories on GitHub.

Then, follow the specifications above to create your application. Work with your instructors to approve your features before you begin working on them.

## Alternative App Option - Store App

If you are struggling to find an idea, you are welcome to create an [Online Store App](./README_STORE_APP.md).

## Project rubric

In addition to the specific requirements, you should aim to score _Proficient_ on all of the criteria listed below. Each rating on the scale, from Developing to Exemplary, is worth 1 point.
